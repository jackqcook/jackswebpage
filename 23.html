    <h3>Golden Year in the Golden Age</h3>
    <p>I turn 23 today. Hard to believe how the years go by. I love birthdays. Not because I like to be showered with attention (I personally am not a fan of the instagram posts and other media attention), but because I really like checkpoints. It’s cool to see the growth that comes with an older version of yourself—firmer beliefs, refined talents, and better alignment to your life’s missions. </p>
    <p>As I’ve sat and thought about the entirety of my life this afternoon, a hard realization dawned on me. I’ve accomplished nothing spectacular in my life. I’ve been good at whatever I’ve set my mind to, but none of these ventures have made a meaningful impact. I’m reaching an age where “potential” has no meaning and results matter. </p>
    <p>Contrary to popular opinion, young people rule the world. The best businesses are built by 20 years olds, the best bands form in their late teens, and sports stars hit their peak coming onto the scene. Youth is a superpower, and for those who don’t fully grasp their unique power at this age, they will certainly regret it down the road. Everything I love was made by crazy young kids who just wanted something different, sick of old established ways and saw an opportunity to do something special. </p>
    <p>This past weekend I attended the Grateful Dead concert at the sphere in Las Vegas. The show was trippy (to say the least) with a cool homage to the band’s origins and the wild ride they’ve had. Surreal sphere visuals of San Francisco and the apartment where Jerry, bob, and the rest of the band started gave a good idea of their innocent start. They didn’t think they’d start a movement, they just wanted to play the music they thought was cool. But that’s the case with most movements, they start with the naive intention of doing something different. The band found each other and ran with it. To this day, their fanbase travels thousands of miles to twirl and be caught up in the psychedelic music.</p>
    <p>There’s something special about the Grateful Dead way of life. It’s not just about the music—it’s about the freedom to wander, to choose the road less obvious. This kind of living isn’t exclusive to Deadheads; it belongs to anyone who trusts themselves enough to follow a path of their own making. In my short life, I’ve noticed that many questions come with answers printed in the back of the book. I’d argue life often feels the same. There are predesigned routes, paved roads with clear signs pointing from A to B. That structure works for a lot of people, and I respect that. But I’ve never been the type to take the straight path. I want the detours. I want the chaos. I want to earn my arrival. </p>
    <p>Where I’m going few have gone before. The road is unpaved and there are plenty of bumps to come. But I am increasingly confident that this is the right path for me. I’m too contrarian to do anything else.</p>
    <p>So while I have not accomplished anything of magnitude (yet), I realize that my path will be different. Great things are on the horizon and with enough sweat, determination, and perseverance, I’ll be where I want to be soon. But for now I’ll keep listening to the words of Jerry Garcia, “There is a road, no simple highway / Between the dawn and the dark of night / And if you go, no one may follow / That path is for your steps alone”</p>
