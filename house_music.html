    <p>I vividly recall my first encounter with electronic music. I was in middle school and I noticed a friend deeply engaged with whatever he was listening to. As a kid trying to gain a grasp of my identity, music was instrumental in helping me differentiate myself from my peers. It was this yearning to hear the unheard and be ahead of the curve that led to me digging through crates to find the newest and coolest stuff. If there was good music, I needed to get my hands on it. That’s why I had to find out what my friend was listening to. I tapped his shoulder and quickly prompted him about what he was listening to, he replied, “have you ever heard of skrillex?” For those who consider themselves electronic music fans, Skrillex is as big as a name can get. He’s one of the few electronic artists to crack into the mainstream with hits like, Bangarang and Where Are Ü Now. The song my friend was listening to that day was Bangarang. On the bus ride home, I opened SoundCloud and played the track. The catchy guitar riff started playing and immediately I was intrigued. The kick drum set in and then the traditional dubstep chaos consumed me. My mind was blown. How could music sound like that? It was chaotic, beautiful, and new. Listening to Bangarang was my first instance of seeing the boundaries of music be tested, and I wanted to be part of it. </p>

    <p>I spent the next few years diving deep into the discographies of Flume, Moby, and especially Daft Punk. While my peers raved about Taylor Swift and Travis Scott, I found a niche group of friends who shared my taste. Music taste is an odd thing. Those who share the same taste have a special connection with one another. It’s not every day that I bump into someone who appreciates Crystal Castles and knows their discography well. Weirdly, I feel like some of these folks understand me better than some of my good friends. It may be our first time meeting, but to like the music I like is an indicator that you’ve experienced and felt similar things to me. Maybe that’s why we like music so much. Perhaps going to concerts isn’t about seeing the artist, but rather seeing a room full of people who understand you. A place where you don’t have to explain why you like what you like.</p>

    <p>In college, I once again discovered my love for electronic music, this time through house music. At its inception during the 1970s, house was mostly an underground phenomenon bringing together a unique crowd. The pioneers of the genre—Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, and Jesse Saunders—focused their attention on 4/4 rhythms, deep basslines, and sampled vocals. The genre had brief stints in the mainstream during the ‘80s and ‘90s, but it wasn’t until the last 5 years that the genre has made a significant surge. Artists like Fred Again.., Peggy Gou, and FISHER are seeing their music gain traction among a bigger audience. Boiler Room and social media have played a big role in helping rising artists find their way onto the playlists of college students.  </p>

    <p>The music is rambunctious. The deep groove lines and catchy synths bring the best out of a party. Even for those hesitant to dance, the music has its way of getting the toughest crowds to enjoy their time. For years I listened to the same playlist of Fergalicious and Gasolina that played at every party, it got old. House is a breath of fresh air. A genre with limitless possibilities. In the years to come, I believe house will take over the music industry. In fact, I think it has the chance to take over the world. We will see the rise of new artists who won’t consider themselves musicians, but rather those who cultivated great taste in music. That’s what makes me most excited about house music. </p>

    <p>As someone who holds a deep reverence for music and musicians, I was always disappointed that I didn’t have the musical talent needed to tour the world. House music is unique in that the barriers to entry aren’t as high as in other genres. Those with curiosity and a willingness to experiment with sound can produce music they are proud of. The advancements in generative artificial intelligence will only aid in this endeavor, providing new tools and possibilities for aspiring producers. </p>

    <p>The future of house music is not just about new beats and rhythms; it’s about the democratization of music creation. Anyone with a computer and a passion for music can contribute to this expanding genre. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the tools available to aspiring producers, making it easier than ever to create professional-quality tracks from a home studio. Inevitably, house music will become a global phenomenon. Kids all around the world will transform the way we think about music creation and its consumption. We will see new ideas and perspectives flow into the genre, pushing the boundaries of sound further.
