    <h3>Pronoia</h3>
    <p>This summer has brought a unique sense of optimism. It feels like things are starting to align in ways I didn't expect. I usually try to stay positive, but this is different—more like a quiet confidence that things are just falling into place. It's as if the world is working in my favor, making things easier and opening up opportunities that once seemed out of reach. It's a feeling of momentum, where everything just seems to click. I guess the word to describe it is pronoia, or the belief that the world is conspiring on your behalf. The wind is at my back, doors are opening, and i'm running downhill.</p>
    <p>I’ve had a few times in my life where I’ve experienced pronoia. My senior year of high school, the final six months of my LDS mission, and my second semester of college. But the last few months have felt like I’ve been banging my head against the wall. Every lead led to nothing. Doors were shut in my face. And boy was I tripping downhill. It’s hard to have patience during these times. It’s easy to get caught up in the wins of others around you and see your defeats as only further evidence that your life isn't going according to plan. But these moments are needed. As much as we wish they weren’t part of our lives, we need red lights in our lives for stopping and reflection. There's a great saying in the midwest for those who are bold enough to move out there: "the winter will eat you alive until you learn to get out in them." There's some profound wisdom in this saying that I am not capable of commenting on. But I've noticed in my life that life in the summer is pretty easy. The warm weather and green leaves block out deep introspection. There's no need to see the forest. But when winter rolls around, we are forced to finally see the forest rather than the trees. It is only on those bone chilling cold days, where the sky is blue that we are able to see the vastness of the forest and all that it has to offer. I've come to value a long winter walk in the woods. The soft, untouched snow and cold air are necessary for the joys of summer.</p>
    <p>I guess the point i'm trying to say is something that we all know. We need winters in our lives. We need opposition. We need reflection. It is only when we have gone through the woods a few times that pronoia seems to come around like a warm wind pushing out winter and welcoming in summer.</p>
