    <h3>Pronoia</h3>
    <p>This summer has been special. I don’t know how to describe it, but I feel a strange sense of optimism that good things are right around the corner. I usually see the glass as half full, but this is different. Some might call it confidence, others might say it’s arrogance. Folks on the internet will call it the white pill, but I’ll call it something else—pronoia. Pronoia is the firm belief that the world around you is conspiring to do you good. It’s a gust of wind at your back, doors magically opening that you once thought were off-limits. It’s the art of running downhill, where everything just seems to flow effortlessly. I pray that this feeling stays a little longer. </p>
    <p>I’ve had a few times in my life where I’ve experienced pronoia. My senior year of high school, the final six months of my LDS mission, and my second semester of college. But the last few months have felt like I’ve been banging my head against the wall. Every lead led to nothing. Doors were shut in my face. And boy was I tripping downhill. It’s hard to have patience during these times. It’s easy to get caught up in the wins of others around you and see your defeats as only further evidence that your life isn't going according to plan. But these moments are needed. As much as we wish they weren’t part of our lives, we need red lights in our lives for stopping and reflection. </p>
