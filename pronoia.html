    <h1>Quentin.J.Cook</h1>
    <h3>Pronoia</h3>
    <p>This summer has been special. I don’t know how to describe it, but I feel a strange sense of optimism that good things are right around the corner. I usually see the glass as half full, but this is different. Some might call it confidence, others might say it’s arrogance. Folks on the internet will call it the white pill, but I’ll call it something else—pronoia. Pronoia is the firm belief that the world around you is conspiring to do you good. It’s a gust of wind at your back, doors magically opening that you once thought were off-limits. It’s the art of running downhill, where everything just seems to flow effortlessly. I pray that this feeling stays a little longer. </p>
