    <h3>Answer Keys</h3>
    <h5>‘If you want to be a grocer, or a general, or a politician, or a judge, you will invariably become it; that is your punishment. If you never know what you want to be, if you live what some might call the dynamic life but what I will call the artistic life, if each day you are unsure of who you are and what you know you will never become anything, and that is your reward.’ — Oscar Wilde</h5>

    <p>Growing up in Northern Utah I always had an answer key for the cardinal directions. I lived right along the east bench and if I ever became disoriented, I knew exactly where to turn to reorient myself—look to lone peak and that is east. Figuring out the other cardinal directions was easy after that. </p>
        
    <p></p>I’ve been thinking a lot about answer keys, and how it’s a useful way of learning and living life. There is something very nice about knowing where to turn and having everything laid out before you. I think of people who follow certain religions where it’s clear what you should be pursuing during each stage of life. I think of people with careers where the path forward is very clear. Do A, then B, and you will get what you desire. With these certain paths, there seems to be a certain Girardian mimetic desire attached to them. People want clear paths, they want certainty, and I don’t blame them one bit. A certain life is in some ways an easier life. </p>
        
    <p></p>I, myself, do not have an answer key. I have some ideas of what an answer key might look like, but in many ways, I’m lost. I’m in the dark as to what is ahead. The area of study I decided to pursue is broad, perhaps too broad. It makes it hard to commit to something and go all in. I am interested in too many things and find myself constantly running down rabbit holes of interesting thoughts. There are many times I wish I had an answer key, some direction for what to pursue. </p>
        
    <p>In recent days, I’ve come to see the value of having no answer sheet. Not having the answers has forced me to be introspective and understand my strengths and weaknesses better than others my age. If I am going to be a trailblazer on my path, I have to know deep down that I trust my judgment and taste. I can’t let the fear of missing out get in the way of paving my trail. I can’t fake confidence; I have to make it. </p>
        
    <p>I’m convinced that detours in life come back to help in odd ways. Perhaps the useless rabbit holes I’ve studied will be the very thing that gives me an edge down the road. The beauty of not having an answer sheet is that everything I do I am responsible for. I have to be savvy, smart, and a little wise to get to where I want to go. But for now, I'll just take one step forward is all I know. </p>
