    <h3>2026 Resolutions</h3>
    <p>2025 was a great year. I learned a lot and feel closer to my potential than ever before. I'm eager for what's ahead and to get the most out of the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>Here is what I hope to achieve this year, and some of the processes I want to implement.</p>
    
    <ol>1. Move to San Francisco</ol>
    <p>I've dreamed of living in the bay area my entire life. I love the west coast: the ocean, cyprus trees, hills, and more. But what I love most about SF is that it is the frontier. If you want to do anything novel and groundbreaking, SF is the best place to be. I feel that I must move to the city and am looking forward to the experiences that await me out there.</p>
    
    <ol>2. Create Value</ol>
    <p>Create value that clears a number in my head. It's not about the money, it's about building something meaningful and impactful for others.</p>
    
    <ol>3. Build social presence</ol>
    <p>Take every advantage of the new medium. 4 tweets a day about the things I'm thinking about, no slop. I am really not fond of tik tok, but I am going to treat it like facetime and document a journey. Promote the business and podcast. Just post dude, the evidence is clear that it will change your life.</p>
    
    <ol>4. Talk to Strangers</ol>
    <p>Moving to a new city, I want to make new friends and find people who inspire me and make me aim higher. If there is someone I find interesting in public (or online), I must talk to them. 1 interesting conversation with someone new each week. I hope to get really good at small talk.</p>
    
    <ol>5. looksmaxx</ol>
    <p>Going for fit cyclist physiognomy. Ultramarathon in March. Gym at least 3 days a week. If the hair isn't cutting it anymore, bic and beard. Guy pearce/ tyler durden physique, no excuses.</p>
    
    <ol>6. Read</ol>
    <p>I'm not putting specific goals or processes for how to do this, but I want to get out of my reading slump and establish consistency.</p>
    

    <p>Every year I have a motto that I hope to revisit throughout the year. For 2026, I've been thinking a lot 
        about the book of Genesis and the creation of the world. In Genesis 2 there is a verse that I find 
        incredibly profound. "And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." 
        The act of creation is ongoing as we continue to build the world around us. What we decide to work on/put our time into 
        is a reflection of who we are and what we love. I hope to be mindful of what the Lord would have me build and to build it with the utmost integrity and purpose.
